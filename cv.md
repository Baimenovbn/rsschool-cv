## Summary:
I want to become the best of myself in CS field. It was just something in this problem solving, that caught my attention immediately.
From very first classes of math (where you are to **solve** problems) I was font of it. Back then I had no idea who programmers actually were, having idea that they are
guys in glasses with thick lenses, greasy hair. Consequently, I got into more of a practical field (Power Engineering), after a while something have happened and i just got sick of my sphere of job. At the time I was talking to my friend, who were in CS. Don't get me wrong, this hasn't happened quickly, I had this thought on my mind for quite a while, but eventually I switched into programming. That was my best decision. As I mentioned earlier there's something cool in solving problems using logic, math, computers. Since I've made up my mind, I have been learning constantly and I can tell that I know much for someone who got into the field with **0** knowledge.<br> **I want to become professional!**
