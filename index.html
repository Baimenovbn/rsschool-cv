        <p>
          I want to become the best of myself in CS field. It was just something in this problem solving, that caught my attention immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          From very first classes of math (where you are to <em>solve</em> problems) I was fond of it. Back then I had no idea who programmers actually were, having idea that they are guys in glasses with thick lenses, greasy hair. Consequently, I got into more of a practical field (Power Engineering), after a while something have happened and I just got sick of my job. At the time I was talking to my friend, who were in CS and what he told me caught my attention. I've had idea of switching to developer position for quite a while. It hasn't happened quickly, but eventually I switched into programming. 
          <strong>That was my best decision.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned earlier there's something cool in solving problems using logic, math, computers. Since I've made up my mind, I have been learning constantly and I can tell that I know much for someone who got into the field with <b>ZERO</b> knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>I want to become professional!</p>
