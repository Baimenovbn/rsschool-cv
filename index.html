      <p>
        I want to become the best of myself in CS field. It was just something in this problem solving, that caught my attention immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        From very first classes of math (where you are to **solve** problems) I was font of it. Back then I had no idea who programmers actually were, having idea that they are guys in glasses with thick lenses, greasy hair. Consequently, I got into more of a practical field (Power Engineering), after a while something have happened and i just got sick of my sphere of job. At the time I was talking to my friend, who were in CS. Don't get me wrong, this hasn't happened quickly, I had this thought on my mind for quite a while, but eventually I switched into programming. That was my best decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned earlier there's something cool in solving problems using logic, math, computers. Since I've made up my mind, I have been learning constantly and I can tell that I know much for someone who got into the field with <bold>ZERO</bold> knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>I want to become professional!</p>
